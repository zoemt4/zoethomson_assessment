ZOE THOMSON CREATIVE CODING ASSESMENT WRITE UP

#1 RUBIKS CUBE - p5js
I chose this output because it took a lot of testing and trialling to get the end result that I wanted. I wanted the rubiks cube to restart shuffiling after it stopped and also for the square that met the criteria. I eventually figured it out, it was due to the order of the if statements and whether they were inside each other or after each other. Through this I learnt how having the if statements in certain orders changes how and when the code will work. This was useful to know because later on in the semester I used if statements and I knew that how they were structured was important.

#2 CREATURE - p5js
This output was really fun to make and I was super happy with the outcome. This was the first week using for loops and I wanted to find a way to make the circles dissapear once the creature touched it (like food). I couldn't figure out how to do this, however I did figure out how to make the circles change colour when they were touched. This involved trialling with the if statements again like the previous example and figuring out where to put it compared to the for loops because otherwise it was making entire rows and columns red instead of one circle.

#3 ROTATING PLAID - p5js
I chose this output because it was super fun to make and it felt good because I was combining knowledge from all the previous weeks and it showed how much I learnt. I combined for loops, noise, translate, rotate, and squares to make this. It is also really satisfying to look at which is another reason why I like this one. This output reminded me of the patterns, shapes, and tesselations that you get when you listen to ambient music and I realised I now knew how to make my own versions of these!

#4 GLOOPY - touch designer
This output was made using a bunch of noises, displace, edge, and feedback. I enjoyed making this one because it was the first time I learned how to animate the noise and have it continuously make random shapes. I later used this gloopy code as a reference to create an audio reactive output by using the noise and animating it. Another thing I learned through this output is how the parameters of noise work and how I can use them to manipulate what it looks like. Learning the parameters was super useful because later on I was using noise all the time to manipulate movement, shapes etc. and I knew what I needed to change to create the result I wanted. 

#5 CRAZY SPHERE - touch designer
This was the first week learning about instancing. In this output I used instancing on a sphere and animated the movement using noise. I also continued implementing aspects from previous weeks like the edge tool and feedback tool. This was kind of confusing at first to understand how to convert the sop to op however after watching a video and expermenting with changing different parameters and the order of things it began to make more sense. I had to add an extra light into this as well because otherwise there was too much shadow. I can use this type of code to make more visual music things!

#6 WEIRD FISHES - touch designer
The audio for this file is weird fishes.
I chose this output because it was the most recent audio reactive output and therefore the best one as I had lots of practice. I learned how to change the threshold to change how much or little audio data was getting picked up which was especially useful for Weird Fishes because at first it was not picking up enough and this meant the animation was hardly going. In this output I experimented with copying using both 2d and 3d objects and it created some cool effects. It was also the first time I animated the colour with audio, which took a while to figure out because you needed to animate the red, green, blue all seperately otherwise it would be shades of grey. I was very happy when I finished this because it turned out so much better than I expected.
