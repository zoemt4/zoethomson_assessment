#1 RUBIKS CUBE - p5js
I chose this output because it took a lot of testing and trialling to get the end result that I wanted. I wanted the rubiks cube to restart shuffiling after it stopped and also for the square that met the criteria. I eventually figured it out, it was due to the order of the if statements and whether they were inside each other or after each other. Through this I learnt how having the if statements in certain orders changes how and when the code will work. This was useful to know because later on in the semester I used if statements and I knew that how they were structured was important.

#2 CREATURE - p5js
This output was really fun to make and I was super happy with the outcome. This was the first week using for loops and I wanted to find a way to make the circles dissapear once the creature touched it (like food). I couldn't figure out how to do this, however I did figure out how to make the circles change colour when they were touched. This involved trialling with the if statements again like the previous example and figuring out where to put it compared to the for loops because otherwise it was making entire rows and columns red instead of one circle.

#3 ROTATING PLAID - p5js
I chose this output because it was super fun to make and it felt good because I was combining knowledge from all the previous weeks and it showed how much I learnt. I combined for loops, noise, translate, rotate, and squares to make this. It is also really satisfying to look at which is another reason why I like this one. This output reminded me of the patterns, shapes, and tesselations that you get when you listen to ambient music and I realised I now knew how to make my own versions of these!

#4 GLOOPY - touch designer
This output was made using a bunch of noises, displace, edge, and feedback. I enjoyed making this one because it was the first time I learned how to animate the noise and have it continuously make random shapes. I later used this gloopy code as a reference to create an audio reactive output by using the noise and animating it. Another thing I learned through this output is how the parameters of noise work and how I can use them to manipulate what it looks like. Learning the parameters was super useful because later on I was using noise all the time to manipulate movement, shapes etc. and I knew what I needed to change to create the result I wanted. 

#5 CRAZY SPHERE - touch designer
This was the first week learning about instancing.

#6 WEIRD FISHES - touch designer
